## Context
The goal of this exercise is to figure out which handwritten digits are most differentiated with PCA.

Scenario - Imagine you are working on an image recognition service for a postal service. It would be very useful to be able to read in the digits automatically, even if they are handwritten. (Quick note, this is very much how modern postal services work for a long time now and its actually more accurate than a human). The manager of the postal service wants to know which handwritten numbers are the hardest to tell apart, so he can focus on getting more labeled examples of that data. You will have a dataset of hand written digits and you will perform PCA to get better insight into which numbers are easily separable from the rest.

This exercise and the associated dataset were provided as part of the excellent course 'Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass' by Jose Portilla on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/), which I successfully completed.
